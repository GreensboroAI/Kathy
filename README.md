# Kathy
Open Source Context Aware Chatbot

# Project
This is an open source chatbot project. Kathy is a basic context aware chatbot model that can be customized with unique responses
for whatever your need is.

# How do I customize it?
For now to customize Kathy you need to create your own .json file in the same format as "intents.json". Once you have input your own
questions and responses you will need to rerun "chatbottrain.py" so a model file can be built off your unique .json file. 

After you run "chatbottrain.py" you can then edit "chatbotrun.py" to test your chatbot.

Given that I have just started this project it is very basic at the moment and requires you to do the above to customize it.
My plan is to work steadily on improving the ease of use for customizing and hopefully it will be relatively easy to do so once I
have completed my work.

# How do I deploy it?
Right now all deployment of this chatbot is up to you. As I get further along in this project I will try and at the least create an
in depth guide to deployment of this chatbot.

# What can I do to help?
Since this is an open source GitHub project feel free to fork the code and make upgrades that you would think are beneficial. I will
try and monitor this project and merge any useful changes to the source.
